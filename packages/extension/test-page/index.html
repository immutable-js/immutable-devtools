Open the console and check that everything looks alright.

<script>
    window.__ExposeIsRecordForTesting = true;
</script>
<!-- Load immutable globally in here, since I want the extension code and the test code to use different instances of Immutable (so we don't rely on instanceof which fail on a normal page when comparing between different Immutable instances) -->
<script src="immutable.min.js"></script>
<script src="test.js"></script>

<script>
setTimeout(function(){
    runTests();
}, 500);
